## Overview:

We and our SpoinkOS ecosystem allows developers to thrive by being able to write NixOS-Like config to install all the packages you need with a single config file after installing the OS. Updates? No problem! You can just specify packages for install in the config so you can set the kernel version you want, its just as easy as that.

## Installation:

To install SpoinkOS, follow these steps:

1. Download the ISO from the Sourceforge Mirror.
2. Create a bootable USB drive using your preferred tool (e.g., Rufus, Etcher).
3. Boot your computer from the USB drive.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install SpoinkOS.
5. (For Developers) To make a NixOS-Like deployment system, first install the OS on hardware or a VM then use CLCTool to execute the deployment / config scripts you have wrote; More info at [CLCTool](https://github.com/SpoinkOSDevs/CLCTool)

## Conclusion:

Thank you for choosing SpoinkOS! We hope you enjoy using our distro as much as we enjoyed creating it!

Happy computing!

## Concept:

The name "SpoinkOS" is inspired by a Pokémon character called Spoink. In the Pokémon series, Spoink is a Psychic-type Pokémon known for constantly bouncing on its spring-like tail. The name "SpoinkOS" reflects the playful and energetic nature of the Pokémon character, and it adds a unique and memorable touch to the Linux distribution. Just like the Pokémon Spoink, which is known for its resilience and determination, SpoinkOS aims to provide a robust and resilient computing experience for its users.

## Pronouced: 

"Spo-ink O-S" as in two words.

## Legal Stuff:

SpoinkOS is GPL Licensed and is managed by SpoinkOS Innovations, we have no affilation with Nintendo™ or Pokemon™ related products or services
