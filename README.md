## Concept:

SpoinkOS belives that where ever you go you have to spring or "Spoink" into action like a spring! So We came up with the name "SpoinkOS".

## Pronouced: 

"Spo-ink O-S" as in two words.

## Legal Stuff:

SpoinkOS is copyleft, SpoinkOS, has no parent company and is owned by a person / person(s) in this sense as though the name is not copyrighted, we have no affilation with Nintendo or Pokemon related products or services as though this is entirely diffrent.

## Fun Fact:

SpoinkOS was orignaly based on the SpoinkBub meme, where SpongeBob got a lolipop. Carl thought it was funny, and thus a new OS was in the market.
