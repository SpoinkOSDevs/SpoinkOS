## Overview:

We and our SpoinkOS ecosystem allows developers to thrive by being able to write NixOS-Like config to install all the packages you need with a single config file after installing the OS. Updates? No problem! You can just specify packages for install in the config so you can set the kernel version you want, easy as that.

## Installation:

To install SpoinkOS, follow these steps:

1. [Download the ISO image](https://archive.org/details/spoink-os) from the Internet Archive mirrior.
2. Create a bootable USB drive using your preferred tool (e.g., Rufus, Etcher).
3. Boot your computer from the USB drive.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install SpoinkOS.
5. (For Developers) To make a NixOS-Like deployment system, first install the OS on hardware or a VM then use CLCTool to execute the deployment / config scripts you have wrote; More info at [CLCTool](https://github.com/SpoinkOSDevs/CLCTool)

## Conclusion:

Thank you for choosing SpoinkOS! We hope you enjoy using our distro as much as we enjoyed creating it!
